NLP Project: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This repository showcases a project completed as part of an NLP course assignment. The goal was to develop and evaluate Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, exploring different architectures and fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Key Features:
Metric Calculation: Custom code to evaluate model performance on a test dataset.
Architecture Experiments: Comparison of multiple NER model architectures to identify the best-performing one.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the learning rate scheduler and optimizer settings to improve model convergence.
End-to-End Training Pipeline: Includes a Jupyter Notebook with a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results analysis.
Best Model Selection: Highlighted the architecture and settings that achieved the highest score.
Technologies Used:
Python
PyTorch / TensorFlow (specify which was used)
Jupyter Notebook
Google Colab
Explore the code and results in the provided Jupyter Notebook to see how the best NER model was developed and evaluated.
